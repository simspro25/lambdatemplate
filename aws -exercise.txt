 4. Using AWS, create a network file system with Amazon Elastic File Systems (EFS). 
 Use the AWS Use Cases web page for step-by-step instructions to add the EFS to an instance of an Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0. 
 Take a screenshot of the result and embed it below.  Specifically, take a screenshot of verifying your file system has been successfully mounted, and the results of creating a test file in your new file system by running a simple dd command to generate a 1GiB file in your new directory.
  Finally, describe the value of a network file system.
